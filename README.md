Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) World Happiness 
From the many news reports in the media, we sometimes think that many countries with developed and advanced status have people who live their lives happily, but there are also many countries that have people with lives that cannot be said to be sufficient. We can analyze this by approaching indicators that influence a country to be said to be happy. For that, let's learn to analyze the "World Happiness" of a country with the following indicators:
- Happy Countries Ranking
- Country Name
- General Public Rating
- GDP per Capita
- Social Assistance
- Life Expectancy
- Freedom of Choice
- Generosity of Its People
- Corruption Perspective on Its Nation
